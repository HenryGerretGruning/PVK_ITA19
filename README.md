## Description
The whole app is build on using the [MVC](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/mvc-architecture#:~:text=MVC%20stands%20for%20Model%2C%20View,data%20retrieved%20from%20the%20database.) method.

The data is stored in PHPMYADMIN which works perfectly with XAMPP listed in the getting started section

## Getting started
You should start off by downloading the project from this repository.

Also this program is made using [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/). It's a comfortable software engineering tool to use and It's highly user friendly.

It's reccomended to use a localhost software ( like [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) ) to host the application on a local computer and test out the features.

There are some minor changes that have to be made to make the program work correctly in your pc.
